                    <div className="accordion-body">React is a javascript library used for creating UI. Everything in react is a component. When we create a component React creates a virtual DOM like browser DOM. This DOM completely looks like real DOM but it's actually a Javascript object. React builds this virtual DOM in such a way that any element can be easily modified using JavaScript with this DOM. React create two virtual DOM. When a user takes any action in DOM, React keeps the change in one DOM and saves the older DOM in another virtual DOM. Then compare these two DOM that which element is specifically changed. After that react don't re-render the whole DOM. Itâ€™s changed Only that element that user was changed.</div>
